# Data Types
## Overview
In Nexus, every piece of data has a data type, which describes the kind of data it is and what kind of operations are supported for it. Variables must declare their data type, and they cannot change, as Nexus is a statically typed language.  
## Supported data types
### [int](./int.md)
